      My name is Jared. I am a programmer, web developer, and general-purpose 
      nerd living in Austin, TX.

    <p class='intro'>
      I have recently finished a degree in Computer Science and English at the 
      University of Texas. I am currently looking for work&mdash;both freelance 
      and full-time.

        <h1>Savin' Eleven</h1>
        <p>
          I worked on this project with 
          <a href='http://designbyash.com'>Ashley Solano</a> and 
          <a href='http://tcschiller.com'>TC Schiller</a> 
          at a hackathon hosted by T-3 and sponsored by 7-Eleven. We hoped to 
          design an app that allowed users to engage with 7-Eleven during a 
          visit with as little effort as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          We came up with Savin' Eleven, a web app that provides the user with 
          a countdown for a free Slurpee every month. If the user checks in at 
          a 7-Eleven location a whole week is taken off the countdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app was a success! After a blistering 24 hours of work we managed 
          to win third place in the hackathon. Our web app was even selected by 
          Seelio as one of their favorite projects of 2013. The 7-Eleven API 
          was only publicly usable for the hackathon, but you can still 
          <a href='https://github.com/tcschiller/savin-eleven'>see our work on Github</a>.

        <h1>GeoBeacon</h1>
        <p>
          I worked with 
          <a href='https://github.com/katieensign'>Katherine Ensign</a> and 
          <a href='http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jefftli/'>Jeffrey Li</a> to 
          develop an Android app that simplifies location sharing for the user. 
          Using GeoBeacon a user can immediately text a friend the nearest 
          address to her location along with a Google Maps URL showing that 
          location.
        </p>
        <p>
          GeoBeacon also provides specialized messaging in case of an 
          emergency. A user can manage an emergency contact list. When a user 
          needs to send a distress message he can share his specific 
          geographic coordinates&mdash;in addition the nearest 
          address&mdash;with the click of a button. The message will be sent to 
          all emergency contacts as well as 911.
        </p>
        <p>
          GeoBecaon is a completed app, however, due to the delay of national 
          <a href='http://www.fcc.gov/text-to-911'>text-to-911</a> 
          implementation we have postponed releasing GeoBecaon on Google Play.
