        <h1>Inkana</h1>
        <p>
        I began learning Japanese around the same time I began learning 
        <a href="https://angularjs.org/">Angular</a>, so I decided to combine 
        them! Inkana is a website built in Angular designed to help users 
        practice learning <i>kana</i>, part of the Japanese writing system.
        </p>
        <p>
        The site provides flashcards. On the front side is just the kana. When 
        the user clicks a card it will flip over to the back side, which shows 
        both the kana and its pronunciation. The code for the site can be 
        <a href="https://github.com/kafkaesc/Inkana">seen on GitHub</a>.

        <h1>Savin' Eleven</h1>
        <p>
          I worked on this project with 
          <a href='http://designbyash.com'>Ash Solano</a> and 
          <a href='http://tcschiller.com'>TC Schiller</a> 
          at a hackathon hosted by T-3 and sponsored by 7-Eleven. We wanted to 
          design an app that allowed users to engage with 7-Eleven during a 
          visit with as little effort as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          We came up with Savin' Eleven, a web app that provides the user with 
          a countdown to a free Slurpee every month. If the user checks in at 
          a 7-Eleven location a whole week is taken off their countdown.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app was a success! After a blistering 24 hours of work we managed 
          to win third place in the hackathon. Our web app was even selected by 
          Seelio as one of their nine favorite projects of 2013. The 7-Eleven 
          API was only publicly usable for the hackathon, but you can still

        <h1>GeoBeacon</h1>
        <p>
          I worked with 
          <a href='https://github.com/katieensign'>Katherine Ensign</a> and 
          <a href='http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jefftli/'>Jeffrey Li</a> to 
          develop an Android app that simplifies location sharing for the user. 
          With GeoBeacon a user can immediately text a friend the nearest 
          address to her location along with a Google Maps URL showing that 
          location.
        </p>
        <p>
          GeoBeacon also provides specialized messaging in case of an 
          emergency. A user can manage an emergency contact list. When a user 
          needs to send a distress message he can share his specific 
          geographic coordinates&mdash;in addition the nearest 
          address&mdash;with the click of a button. The message will be sent to 
          all emergency contacts as well as 911.
        </p>
        <p>
          GeoBecaon is a completed app, however, due to the delay of national 
          <a href='http://www.fcc.gov/text-to-911'>text-to-911</a> 
          implementation we have postponed releasing GeoBecaon on Google Play.

        <h1>Cold War</h1>
        <p>
          The theme for 
          <a href='http://globalgamejam.org/news/ggj14-theme'>Global Game Jam 2014</a> 
          was, "We don't see things as they are, we see them as we are." After 
          a bit of philosophical pondering, my team came up with a concept. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Cold War is a game of perpetual defense. The player takes command  
          of astronauts defending a base on Mars from incoming snowmen. The 
          play area is a grid displaying the incoming snowmen, and each turn 
          the player can spend resources to deploy various units. Our personal 
          favorite is the giant toaster that catches and melts snowmen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not only does the player have to worry about units, she must also 
          occasionally change perspective. There are three types of snowmen: 
          common, uncommon, and rare. But a player can only identify two types 
          at any given time. The rare snowmen wear a red scarf and do a lot of 
          damage. The uncommon snowmen wear a blue scarf and only do a moderate 
          amount of damage. In red mode a player can see the rare snowmen, and 
          in blue mode she can see the uncommon snowmen. The user must 
          occasionally change perspective to find out which snowmen are rare or 
          uncommon, because if he stays in one mode some of them will just look 
          like common snowmen!
